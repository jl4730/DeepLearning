# DeepLearning and CNN
Summary of what I learned from Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Deep Learning Section. Medium post at https://medium.com/@jl4730/deep-learning-and-convolutional-neural-network-a6deb2983a41

### 1.1 SimplePerceptronAlgorithm.py
Classify a group of points with y is either 0 or 1 using perceptron algorithm

### 1.2 GradientDescent.ipynb
Implement the gradient descent algorithm on the dataset with two classes

### 1.3 StudentAdmissions.ipynb
Put neural networks in practice by analyzing a dataset of student admissions at UCLA

### 1.4 StudentAdmissionsKeras
Use Keras to train a simple model

### 1.5 IMDB_In_Keras.ipynb
